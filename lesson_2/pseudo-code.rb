#1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

# Ask the user for two numbers

# Store each number into a variable

# define a method that takes two parameters

# create a variable called result within the method 

# assign it to the expression num1 + num2 

# output the result to the user

#2. 

#START
# PRINT "What is your first number?"
# GET the first number 
# SET num1 to the first number

# PRINT "What is your second number?"
# GET the second number 
# SET num2 to the second number

# DEF a method called sum with two parameters (num1, num2)
# SET result to num1 + num

#PRINT result

#END

#2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# Define a method called "concat" that takes one parameter called "array"

# Join each item of the array together to form one single array

# Convert the new array to a string

# Output the results 

#START 

#DEF a method called concat with one parameter (array)

#SET new_array to equal array.join(" ")

#SET new_array to new_array.to_s()

#PRINT new_array

#END


#3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the orignal array, starting with the first element

# Define a method called "everyOther" that accepts one parameter called "array"

# Output the first element of the array 

# Create a variable called new_array assign it to the return value of every other integer from the argument 

# Output new_array 


#START 

# DEF a method called everyOther with one parameter (array)

#PRINT the first element of the array

#SET new_array to equal the return value of every other integer from the original array 

#PRINT new_array 

#END
